## Core loop

A business owner turns a customer's request into a quote, a quote into a scheduled job, sends a technician, and gets paid. In Jobber that payment is by card. Ours: **M-Pesa / Mixx by Yas / Airtel Money, with a TRA-compliant receipt.**

## Flows

```
F01 Customer request becomes a quote
    S16 (or S05 by staff) -> S06 -> S08 -> send via WhatsApp/SMS link -> S16 approve
    happy path clicks: ~8
    edge: customer asks for changes (new revision), quote expires, customer declines

F02 Approved quote becomes a scheduled job
    S08 approved -> convert -> S10 -> S11 assign technician + time
    happy path clicks: ~4
    edge: double-booked tech, recurring maintenance contract

F03 Technician does the visit
    S12 open visit -> check in -> S13 checklist + photos -> customer signature -> complete
    happy path taps: ~6
    edge: no data signal (offline), extra parts used, visit needs a follow-up

F04 Invoice and get paid
    S10 complete -> S15 create invoice -> send -> S16 pay via mobile money -> receipt
    happy path clicks: ~4 (customer: ~3)
    edge: part payment, overdue reminders, payment made outside the app (cash/bank)

F05 Recurring maintenance
    S10 recurring job -> visits auto-created -> S11 -> F03 -> F04 per visit or per period
    edge: contract renewal, skipped visit
```

## Feature matrix

See `features.csv`. Must: 18, should: 12, could: 6, skip: 3. A further 7 rows marked `original=no` are Dar es Salaam additions. They are the reason to buy this over Jobber.

## Out of scope (cannot or should not be cloned)

- Jobber's name, logo, copy, colours and marketing site.
- Its app marketplace and partner integrations (QuickBooks, Xero, Stripe-based Jobber Payments, Jobber Capital financing).
- Its US marketing services (Google review campaigns, websites) and licensed content.

## Size

Screens 20, flows 5, entities 13.
Hard parts:
1. **Mobile-money collection.** Use one aggregator (e.g. Selcom, AzamPay or ClickPesa; to be confirmed) instead of three direct telco integrations.
2. **TRA fiscal receipts (VFD).** Needs a TRA-registered VFD provider or API. This is a regulatory dependency, so start with "attach the EFD receipt number" and go live with VFD later.
3. **Offline technician app.** Sync and conflicts.

Size: **M/L** (several weeks to a quarter) built from scratch.
